A quick proxy for the masses. Use it anywhere to preserve your privacy in one unified web bundle.

## Why ClickyCloak?

ClickyCloak combines web proxies and BreakRoomLite and brings the best of both worlds.

## No tracking

ClickyCloak uses no analytics and ads. Your data is safe and there is no privacy violations in the code.

## Lightweight and well coded

CodeFactor autogrades ClickyCloak to an A+ most of the time. The HTML is designed to be compliant to the WCAG and ADA  
as much as possible. Every file are mere kilobytes of text.

## Anti-blocking and hard to track

Ultraviolet + tested censorship hardening prevents blocking from extensions. The sheer amount of proxies (more proxies will be added)and shuffling (will add soon) makes network level bans difficult to preform.
